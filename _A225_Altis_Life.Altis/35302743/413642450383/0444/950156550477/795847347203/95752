				1: Vehicles are not a weapon. You can use a vehicle to defend yourself if you are in immediate danger and the threat is directly in front of your vehicle. Bannable uses of vehicles include but are not limited to: running innocent people over for fun, ramming into stationary vehicles with the intent to blow them up, turning around to run over someone shooting at you from behind.<br/>
				2: Vehicle mounted weapons fall under the same rules as any other weapon.<br/>
				3: Disconnecting or re-spawning while being engaged by another player is a bannable offense (Combat Logging). Claims of RDM/other rule violations are not a defense for Combat Logging.<br/>
				4: Illegal areas are marked in red text on the map and include drug fields, drug processing areas, drug dealers, black market factories, cartels, and rebel outposts.<br/>
				5: Players in and around illegal areas are responsible for their own survival as <b>RDM RULES DO NOT APPLY</b>. See our forums for a detailed list of the illegal area ranges.<br/>
				6: Random Death Matching (RDM):  Is the act of killing a player outside of an illegal area without valid RP reason and communication via in-game direct voice communication or cell phone text messages.  RDM is  a bannable offence. Example: you tell someone to STOP and put their hands on their head. If they comply you can role-play out robbing them, if they do not you are allowed to kill. If someone complies with your demands, you must continue the roleplay and find another reason to kill them.<br/>
				7: Warning shots are allowed at helicopters that are hovering or attempting to land near your position.  If the helicopter does not turn away, shooting it down is allowed. Remember, sufficient time must be given to allow the pilot to react and decide to leave.<br/>
				8: The rules are not designed to shield players from the consequences of their own actions or lack of awareness.   It is not considered RDM if players die for reasons such as: ignoring demands from any player, trying to drive through on-going gunfire, running into an active firefight, etc.<br/>
				9: Players must have in-game sound effects turned up so they can hear direct voice communication from other players.<br/>
				10: The use of racist, misogynistic, or hate speech will result in a permanent ban from the Asylum Servers.<br/>
				11: As a Bounty Hunter, do not profit by arresting your friends. Additionally, do not share your reward with the bounty that you have arrested. Such funds will be removed from your respective bank accounts and depending on severity, may result in a ban.<br/>
				12: Ghosting (abuse of persistent player location saving) will result in a server ban. Do not use the ability to logout/login to gain a tactical advantage over your enemies.<br/>

				Illegal Areas (marked on the map as red markers) are Kill on Sight (KOS) zones. As such RDM RULES DO NOT APPLY. Some of these areas have extended KOS areas which surround the marker but may not necessarily be displayed on the map. Below is a summary of the redzones on Asylum.<br/><br/>
				Persistent 300 Meter Redzones:<br/>
				1. All Drug/Illegal Item Fields<br/>
				2. All Drug/Illegal Item Processors<br/>
				3. All Rebel Bases<br/>
				4. Black Market Production Facilities<br/>
				5. Cartel Locations<br/>
				6. Aircraft Carrier<br/><br/>
				Persistent Specific-Range Redzones:<br/>
				1. Drug Dealers/Wongs Food and Liquor: (Interaction Range)<br/>
				2. Drug Runner Locations: (50m Radius from the vendor)<br/>
				3. Turtle Zones: (Red Circle on Map)<br/><br/>
				Event-Specific Redzones:<br/>
				1. Gas Station Robberies: (Immediate Area - Only armed players may be killed)<br/>
				2. Federal Reserve Robbery / Prison Break / Bank Robbery: (Immediate Area. These zones of conflict can understandably stretch across a relatively wide area; so please use your best judgment when engaging contacts who you know may not be involved in the event. Administrators will handle reports or RDM from near these locations on a case-by-case basis.)<br/><br/>
				Any player who is within the boundaries identified above may be killed or downed by any player at any time. You may be outside of an Illegal Area and fire upon those who are inside without initiation of roleplay.<br/><br/>
				In addition; any player whose name displays as RED may be fired upon without fear of repercussion. Red Names indicate that the player is either in a Gang War with you, or that their group is in a firefight with your group.<br/>

				7: Taking someone hostage is a illegal act.<br/>
				8: As a civilian, only guns purchased at city gun stores are considered legal when you have the required licence. All other guns are illegal including: Guns purchased from the rebel bases, guns obtained without a licence, and guns picked up from police officers. The SDAR is illegal, even if it may be purchased from the gun store.<br/>
				9: Interfering with an arrest after being warned will warrant an arrest with ticket and possible jail time.<br/>

				13: Any form of impersonating an officer is considered illegal.<br/>
				14: If a killing happens in self defence and you want to ensure your innocence, you must contact the police via 911's or in-person as soon as possible. If you wait to inform them of the self-defense homicide, your chances of being ticketed/jailed increase significantly!<br/>

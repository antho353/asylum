					1: Player Housing: The first step to owning a home is obtaining a home owner license from the DMV. With the license, find a vacant home in the world and you may see a buy house action menu option. You may lock doors of your homes and with access to Home Improvements, place storage containers in your homes. Larger and more expensive homes will offer more storage ability. You have the ability to spawn at your home upon death. Additionally, you may own garages and access your garage from them! (Be careful, vehicles larger than the garage may result in explosions).<br/>
					2: Hostage Taking: You can take hostages in Asylum Life by having another player press the TAB key, this will activate surrender mode. You may also shoot your target with a less-lethal weapon. When your target is in surrender mode or downed, you can restrain, escort, put into, and pull them out of vehicles.<br/>
					3: Cartels: Gangs may take control of various cartel locations in order to gain financial or other benefits. Claim your territory!<br/>
